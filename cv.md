 ## About me 
 > “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.” — __Henry Ford__

I am Ekaterina. I am in my late 30s and have been studying the frontend for a few years with a practical goal - to improve my analytical thinking and keep my mind sharp. At first, these classes were sometimes challenging, but they also brought me pleasure. Eventually, they became a goal to master a new profession, and in the future, even to become part of the amazing IT culture.

Before joining Rs School, I had been studying programming on my own and had even successfully completed a course as a front-end developer at the HTML Academy. However, I still felt the need to practice and consolidate the knowledge and skills I had acquired. To overcome this uncertainty, I decided to become a student at Rs School and I believe this course will help me gain more confidence in myself.
